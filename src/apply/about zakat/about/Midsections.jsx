          <P>
            Zakat is the third pillar of Islam, and a key part of the Islamic
            socio-economic system. By giving part of their wealth as Zakat,
            Muslims perform a religious duty, cleanse their own wealth in the
            eyes of God, and help to uplift the faith and standard of life of
            the entire Muslim community.

          <P>
            Zakat is not just random charity, itâ€™s a unique form of religious
            social welfare with specific guidelines about who should receive it
            and a purpose it should achieve. Its ultimate aim is to strengthen
            faith and uphold the religion of Islam by providing a safety net for
            certain set categories of Muslims.
