        By giving Zakat through National Zakat Foundation you enable us to be
        there for Muslims in need throughout the country and help unlock the
        potential of Muslims being held back by their financial circumstances.
        Your Zakat is added to the funds you have chosen and pooled together
        with the Zakat of other local Muslims nationwide who have chosen to
        bring Zakat to life here in the UK. We spread the distribution of Zakat
        throughout the year so that weâ€™re able to use your Zakat to help Muslims
        who qualify for Zakat when they need it most.
