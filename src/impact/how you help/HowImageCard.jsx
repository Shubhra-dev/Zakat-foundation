        By giving Zakat through AL-ZAKATI you enable us to be there for Muslims
        in need throughout the country and help unlock the potential of Muslims
        being held back by their financial circumstances. Your Zakat is added to
        the funds you have chosen and pooled together with the Zakat of other
        local Muslims nationwide who have chosen to bring Zakat to life here in
        Bangladesh. We spread the distribution of Zakat throughout the year so
        that weâ€™re able to use your Zakat to help Muslims who qualify for Zakat
        when they need it most.
