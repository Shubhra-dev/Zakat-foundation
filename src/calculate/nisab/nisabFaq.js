    ques: "What is nisab?",
    ans: "Nisab is the minimum wealth threshold a Muslim must possess to be obligated to pay Zakat. It was established by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and is defined as either 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver. Some scholars also mention an alternative value of 85 grams of gold or 595 grams of silver. This threshold ensures that Zakat is only paid by those who have sufficient wealth.",

    ans: "The Nisab threshold, as set by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), is 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver. An alternative opinion suggests 85 grams of gold or 595 grams of silver. These values serve as the benchmark for determining whether a Muslim is required to pay Zakat.",

    ques: "How much is the Nisab in Taka?",
    ans: "To calculate the Nisab value in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), you need to refer to the current market prices of gold and silver. These prices fluctuate daily, so itâ€™s important to check the latest rates to determine the exact Nisab amount in BDT.",

    ques: "Which standard should I use, gold or silver?",
    ans: "While both gold and silver standards are valid, the silver standard is often recommended because it lowers the Nisab threshold, enabling more people to fulfill their Zakat obligation. This approach maximizes the collective benefit to the community. However, the choice between gold and silver depends on your intention, local practices, and financial circumstances.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    ques: "Why is there a gold Nisab and a silver Nisab?",
    ans: "The existence of both gold and silver Nisab standards reflects the flexibility and inclusivity of Islamic teachings. It ensures that Zakat remains accessible and effective across different economic contexts. By offering two standards, Islamic law accommodates varying wealth levels and historical practices, making Zakat a comprehensive system for wealth redistribution and social welfare.",
